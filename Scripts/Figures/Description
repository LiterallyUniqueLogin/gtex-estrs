#RNA binding proteins
RBPs have crucial roles in various cellular processes such as: cellular function, transport 
    and localization. They especially play a major role in post-transcriptional control of RNAs, 
    such as: splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stabilization, mRNA localization and translation.
#transcription factors
