To reproduce our results the following scripts can be run step by step.
For more details read the corresponding note in the Help_Notes DIR


get_pop_info_2_plot.sh	->	We start with population control


plot_pcs.r 		->	Plot the first 2 PCs from the output from above


get_rpkm_by_tissue.py	->	We partition the expression data by tissue type restricting to the 148 WGS


get_peer_confounders.r	->	We infer hidden expression determinants from the expression profiles 
				get_peer_confounders.r tissueofchoice_expression	##Here we run for each tissue separately

get_strs.sh		->	We now call STRs from bam file. [just provide the list]
                                runparallel.sh will run get_strs.sh by chromosomes in parallel


sanity_check_plot.r	->	We do a quick sanity check on the STR calls and stutter model

 
GetNormalizedGenotypes.py->	We format the STRs genotypes in vcf file for eqtl analysis


LinRegAssociationTest.py->	We run the Linear regression analysis with 


get_eSTRs.sh		->	We run the eSTRs identification 
				runparallel.sh will run get_strs.sh by chromosomes in parallel

---------		->	We can plot to obeserve the results
