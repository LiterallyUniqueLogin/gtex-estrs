1- Get the Sraruntable file which contains all information ablut the data available for this project.
This file was obtained by Mellissa (PI) from dbgap

We want to retrieve all whole genome sequencing runs (WGS) data from the dataset

	zcat SraRunTable.txt.gz | grep WGS > Sra_table_WGS_only
 try		less -S Sra_table_WGS_only

Observation : Column 15 has an "SRR" number, which is an SRA identifier that can be used to download the sra file.
We can remove all SRR into a file.. Here we named it SRR_IDs_table_Sra_WGS_only

	awk '{print $15}' Sra_table_WGS_only > SRR_IDs_table_Sra_WGS_only

Each ID (SRR#######) from this file can be used to download the corresponding whole genome as so.
From the dbgap folder, we can run the following command. As a prerequisite, the path to the key should be in your path.
All of this is done during the environment set up for dbgap data.

	prefetch --max-size 100G SRR##ID##

Once the SRR##ID##.sra file is downloaded, we convert it to BAM

	sam-dump -u sra/SRR##ID##.sra | samtools view -bS - > SRR##ID##.bam	

We index the BAM file 

	samtools index SRR##ID##.bam

Now the BAM files are ready for analysis. Because all this take so much space, deleting the SRR####.sra is perfect for space saving

##### Copy run.sh in the dbgap-xxxx directory. The file download_sra_2_bam.sh should be present as well
