1- Remove genes Ids from the Expression data
 awk '{print $1}' Tissuename_expression.tsv >ids ##In this case Tissuename_ is wholeblood

2- remove unwanted characters (quotes, and ;)
 sed 's/;//' ids > tmp
 sed 's/"//' tmp > ids

3- We alredy removed all gene from the gencode annotation version 19
	and formatted it to the EXPRANNOT format (Melissa)
		with this commands
**
zgrep -v '^#' /storage/szfeupe/data/gencode.v19.annotation.gtf.gz | awk '$3 == "gene" {print $1","$4","$5","$10","$7","$1","$4","$5","$12","$7}' > Genehg19.annot.expr.txt

** Then remove unwanted char ; " and "
sed 's/"//' Genehg19.annot.expr.txt > tmp
sed 's/;//' tmp1 > Genehg19.annot.expr.txt

4- Then we can get our well formattes Expression annotation file with only 
genes that are present in the expression file and in that same order

  awk -F, 'FNR==NR {a[$4]=$0; next}; $1 in a {print a[$1]}' Genehg19.annot.expr.txt ids.txt > Tissuename_Expr_annot.txt
